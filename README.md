# **GeoGPT Analysis Toolset**

**GeoGPT** is a powerful geospatial analysis application designed to perform complex operations based on user prompt, offering tailored solutions to spatial data analysis challenges. Users can input natural language prompts or predefined commands, and the application executes a wide range of geospatial tasks, such as spatial analysis, data transformations, and map generation, aimed at simplifying the workflow for professionals and researchers in the field of geospatial sciences.

At the core of **GeoGPT** is a comprehensive analysis toolset that allows users to interact with both vector and raster data formats. The tools provide essential operations such as spatial joins, data projections, distance calculations, and land use classification. Whether you are working with satellite imagery, shapefiles, or other geospatial data, GeoGPT integrates seamlessly into your existing workflows, offering an intuitive interface for sophisticated analysis without requiring deep technical expertise.

The **GeoGPT** Analysis package further enhances this functionality by supporting advanced spatial operations, machine learning models for predictive analysis, and integration with popular geospatial libraries like GeoPandas and Rasterio. This robust toolset ensures that users can tackle a variety of spatial challenges with efficiency and accuracy.

## **Installation**

You can easily install the package using **pip**:

### **From PyPI (Recommended)**

```bash
pip install @geogpt/toolset
```

### **From Source**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justtife/GeoGPT-Analysis-Package.git
   cd GeoGPT-Analysis-Package
   ```

2. Install in development mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```
This will install the package in editable mode, allowing you to make changes to the source code and immediately see the effect without needing to reinstall the package.

## **Usage**

After installation, you can start using the package in your Python code:

### Example:

```python
from @geogpt/toolset import NetworkAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer with your geospatial data
analyzer = NetworkAnalyzer("path_to_your_data.geojson")

# Perform an analysis (e.g., road network analysis)
result = analyzer.analyze_road_network()

# Output the results
print(result)
```

<!-- ## **Examples**

You can find example scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how to use **GeoGPT Analysis Toolset** in the [examples/](examples/) directory. These examples cover various use cases to help you get started:

### **1. Basic Land Use Analysis**

This example demonstrates how to perform land use classification on geospatial data using machine learning models. You can follow the steps in the script to process your own data and generate useful insights about land usage patterns in a given area.

### **2. Spatial Join**

In this example, we show how to perform a spatial join between two geospatial datasets based on their geographic proximity. This operation is commonly used to merge datasets that share a spatial relationship but are stored separately.

### **3. Predictive Analysis**

This example leverages machine learning models for predictive geospatial analysis. You will learn how to train a model using geospatial features and make predictions on new data. The tutorial covers the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Each of these examples can be run directly as standalone scripts or in Jupyter notebooks, making it easy for you to test them with your own data and modify them as needed. -->
